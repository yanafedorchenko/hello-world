Just another repository

Hi Humans!

I'm Yana and I'm gonna miss my project deadline. I'm sad about it because I worked really hard this past week to finish it on time. But I think I'll need this knowledge next semester. That's what I'm telling myself to feel better. Well, maybe not everything's lost yet. I hope to learn how to use GitHub Classroom fast.
